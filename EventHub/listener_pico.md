# Learning with a listener pico

A pico, named "IICS Absorb updater", is running on a linux machine on-prem.

The steps in the README in this same folder were followed, but for production,
and a webhook has been established for the HR_Personal_Actions/Hired events.
There is no code yet, but the logging should show any incoming events.

Waiting for such to appear, as hiring progresses during the day.
